Four exercises for course Distributed Systems represents client-server lamport clock application, work with cluster nodes, fault-tolerance and framework Spark. Exercises has been created for University of Helsinki.

I learned the most from the project A Tale of Cats and a Mouse, because it represents the real situation in distribution process.

I have to say a big thank to professor Jussi Kangasharju, because this is only a few parts of his course, which inspired me a lot.
